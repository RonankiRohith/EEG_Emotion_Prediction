# EEG_Emotion_Prediction
The aim of the project is to predict Emotions Based on the EEG Readings retrieved from the Brain signals. Given EEG data from subjects who were watching movies, let's try to predict the emotional state of a subject during a given movie. We will use a TensorFlow recurrent neural network to make our predictions.
